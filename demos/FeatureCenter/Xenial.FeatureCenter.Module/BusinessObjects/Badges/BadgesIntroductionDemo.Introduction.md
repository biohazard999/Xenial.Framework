Badges are a method to put your users attention to certain elements in the UI or help to indicate the state of something.

It's used here in the FeatureCenter to indicate the current state of parts of Xenial.

* **Lab** - Indicates that this is an experimental module, that might be removed in a future version. You **should** *never* use that in an production app.
* **Alpha** - Indicates that this component is not API stable yet. Several planned features might be missing and is not fully tested yet. Expect breaking changes in future versions. You *might* use this in production apps, but *expect* issues.
* **Beta** - Indicates that this component is feature complete, but not fully tested yet. Breaking changes are unlikly to occur. This is a *go live* for production.
* **Stable** - Indicates that this component is used in production for a very long time and no breaking changes should occur. This is *battle tested* for production.

            Tasty isn't developed by a big, faceless corporation or backed by mountains of venture capital.<br>
            It's mostly <a href="https://github.com/biohazard999" target="_blank">Manuel</a> and other awesome contributors spending lots of nights and weekends as a labor of love.
        </p>
        <p>
            Development and support of Tasty took off quickly and there are no plans to slow down.<br>
            In fact, there are some <strong>big plans</strong> for Tasty in the future.<br>
            I hope to have a GitHub Sponsor account specifically for the <a href="https://github.com/xenial-io" target="_blank">Xenial project</a> soon, but in the meantime if you appreciate this project and would like to show some support,
            please consider <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/biohazard999" target="_blank">sponsoring Manuel on GitHub Sponsors</a>.
